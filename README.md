URL Builder
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/url-builder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/url-builder) [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/hmrc/releases/url-builder/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/hmrc/releases/url-builder/_latestVersion)

Micro-library for building URLs from templates and tags.

* Creates links with settings that are appropriate to the target. See [Link](src/main/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/urls/Link.scala)'s companion object:
```scala
Links.toInternalPage            // No SSO, Same Window
Links.toExternalPage            // No SSO, New Window
Links.toPortalPage              // Client-based SSO, Same Window
Links.toInternalPageWithSso     // Server-based SSO, Same Window
```
* Constructs parametrized urls based on the tags and corresponding values provided.

## Usage

* **`Link`** can be used in scala html templates to generate consistent links across a page:

```scala
@import uk.gov.hmrc.urls.Link
<li>
  @{Link.toPortalPage(id = Some("link-id"),
                      url = "http://someserver:8080/something",
                      value = Some("Placeholder text displayed for the link")).toHtml}
</li>
```

* **`UrlBuilder`** can be used to build a URL based on parameters from a (tag, value) map:

```scala
UrlBuilder.buildUrl("http://server:8080/something/<tag1>/<tag2>",
                     Seq("<tag1>"->Some("value1"), "<tag2>"->Some("value2"))
                    )
```
would produce the url: `http://someserver:8080/something/value1/value2`


## Adding to your service

Include the following dependency in your SBT build

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("hmrc", "releases")

libraryDependencies += "uk.gov.hmrc" %% "url-builder" % "x.x.x"
```

## Run the tests and sbt fmt before raising a PR

Format:

`sbt fmt`

Then run the tests and coverage report:

`sbt clean coverage test coverageReport`

If your build fails due to poor test coverage, *DO NOT* lower the test coverage threshold, instead inspect the generated report located here on your local repo: `/target/scala-2.12/scoverage-report/index.html`

Then run the integration tests:

`sbt it:test`
